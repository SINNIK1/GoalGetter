## Challenges Encountered

- **Dependency Management**: Managing and updating dependencies, especially in a rapidly evolving ecosystem, sometimes led to compatibility issues and required significant time to resolve.
- **Database Integration**: Integrating SQLite for local data storage was the most challenging part which required careful planning, especially in handling asynchronous operations.


### Group Lists:
  Users should be able to create different "groups" or categories to organize their
  tasks.
### Todo Lists:
  Within each group, users should be able to add multiple todo items.
  Each todo item should have a title and a description.
### Task Management:
  The app should allow users to mark tasks as completed or pending.
  Users should have the option to edit or delete tasks.
